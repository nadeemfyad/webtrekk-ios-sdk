### Cocoapod Swift 4.2 trouble (< 4.14.0):
To resolve when you cannot lint with Cocoapods, use:

`pod spec lint --allow-warnings`

### Use the Legacy Build System for building (< 4.14.0):
- File
    - Project/Workspace Settings
      - Shared Workspace Settings
        - Build System -> `Legacy Build System`

There are a few warnings with the new API in Swift 4.2, all will still work. It's just warnings and we will work to make them disappear by the time a new Swift version is out.

No screen resolution and automatic network status tracking support.

watchOS support starting with version 4.3.0 with the following limiations:

# Migrating from Webtrekk SDK V3

The Webtrekk SDK V4 offers the possibility to migrate some stored information to the new SDK. This option is enabled as per default but in case the old data should be neglected and deleted the value of the `migratesFromLibraryV3` variable needs to be set to `false` before creating the first tracker. The code snippet below shows this case.

```swift
WebtrekkTracking.migratesFromLibraryV3 = false
```

Following properties are part of the migration.

| Option           | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `everId`         | previously generated everId for the user                          |
| `appVersion`     | previously stored appVersion used to detect app updates           |
| `optedOut`       | previously stored status which is only migrated if not set before |
| `samplingState`  | previously stored samplingState                                   |
| `unsentRequests` | previously saved unsent requests                                  |

# SSL

As of iOS 9 Apple is more strictly enforcing the usage of SSL for network connections. Webtrekk highly recommends and offers the usage of a valid serverUrl with SSL support. In case there is a need to circumvent this. The App will need an exception entry within the `Info.plist`. Apple's regulations about this are well documented within the [iOS Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33)
